	------clustering Tests-----
	This program uses a euclidean clustering algorithm.
	After clustering each cluster is than represented as a sphere.
	each cluster retains it's location, approximate size, and approximate points.
	The name of the file to be processed is asked for at run-time.
	The name of the file to be saved is asked for at run-time.
	----variables----
	(int) maximum points
	(int) minimum points
	(float) cluster tolerance

	----Feeding variables from a file.----
	If you want to run the program without entering the variables each time:
	Create an empty file. The name doesn't mater.
	Enter the values you want to use for the variables in the order that they appear int the ReadMe file.
	Each variable should be separated with a new line.
	run the program with the fallowing terminal command. 
	
	./<Program name> < <Variable File name> 
	
	Example:
	
	
		Terminal:
		./TestProgram < param.txt
	
	
		ReadMe.txt:
		==============
		---TestProgram---
		xxxxxxxx
		xxxxxxxxx
		xxxxx
		----Variables----
		(float)	xxxxx
		(int)	xxxx
		(string)xxxxx
		(float)	xxxx
		
		---footer------
		xxxxxxx
		xxxx
		xxxxxx
		==============
		
		
		
		param.txt:
		==============
		2.0
		5
		test test
